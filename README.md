# Gender-Recognition-from-Face-Images-Based-on-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-
Recognition from face images based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dataset source was obtained from the Kaggle website, Github, and the acquisition itself using a mobile phone camera. The total number of datasets used in this project is 6856 images divided into three parts: training, validation, and test. There are two classes used, namely the female and male classes. The CNN model is designed using five convolution layers for the feature extraction part. Several optimizations were made to the parameters of the number of epochs, learning rate, and batch size to get the best performance.
